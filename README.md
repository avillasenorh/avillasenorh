### Hi there 👋

I am a seismologist at the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC) in Barcelona.

I work on Seismic Tomography using different kinds of data: arrival times of body waves,
dispersion measurements of surface waves, seismic ambient noise.

I also have an interest in Global Seismology, particularly in earthquakes occurred during the
early instrumental period (before the mid 1960's).
